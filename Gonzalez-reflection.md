#Gonzalez reflection

*I had not dealt with git push and pull in a few years, so I struggled with those prior to the GPS session.
*Certain terminal tricks were clarified, like using tab to fill in a file name.
*I did not have a pair. The questions that I asked my guide were about clarifying nuance between git commit and git push, and getting refreshed on what the git flow is (since Uber uses arc diff after a commit).
*I'm still a little bit confused on the push and pull; I'll look forward to someone actually reviewing my code and accepted the merge.
*My first GPS was okay, but I didn't have a pair so that was tough. I didn't mind it, but I also felt I missed out a bit.
